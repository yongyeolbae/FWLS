Experiments 1–3 use the same evaluation pipeline (IoU and FWLS) with different input mask sets.
Therefore, we provide a unified evaluation interface in fwls/fwls_score() and demonstrate usage in the main README.
The repository includes dedicated scripts for Experiments 4–5, which constitute the main reproducible benchmarks.
