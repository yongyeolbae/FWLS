Experiments 1–4 use the same evaluation pipeline (IoU and FWLS) with different input mask sets.
Accordingly, we provide a unified evaluation interface in `fwls/fwls_score()` and demonstrate
how to evaluate any (GT, prediction) mask set in the main README.
Experiment 5 involves a supplementary training study and is documented separately under `experiments/exp5_supp_training/`.
